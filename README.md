# Task 2 - Contact Form & Dynamic To-Do List

This project is part of my **Web Development Internship** at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.

It is a responsive and interactive web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The app includes a **Contact Form** with JavaScript validation and a **Dynamic To-Do List** where users can add, mark as completed, and delete tasks.  
The design uses the same diffused gradient background and style as Task 1 for visual consistency.
